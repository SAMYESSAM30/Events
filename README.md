## Task Completion

I have successfully completed the task which includes creating a website using Next.js, utilizing the MUI library for design. The website consists of three pages:

1. **Login Page:**
   - Features a login form with email and password fields.
   - To log in, use the credentials:
     - Email: admin@admin.com
     - Password: admin01

2. **Home Page:**
   - Displays an Event List with information such as event title, date, duration, and location.

3. **Event Details Page:**
   - Contains information on all previous events, along with a rich description.
   - Includes a section displaying the first 5 users who have joined the event.
   - Clicking on the list of joined users opens a paginated pop-up/modal window showing all users who have joined the event.
